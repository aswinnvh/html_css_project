        <h1>How electric Bike/Scooters Work?</h1>
        <p>Electric Bikes function by plugging into a charge point and taking electricity from the grid. They store the electricity in rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor, which turns the wheels. Electric Bikes accelerate faster than vehicles with traditional fuel engines. So they feel lighter to ride. Each model has a different range, battery size and efficiency. There are a few different types of electric bikes(EV). Some run purely on electricity, these are called pure electric bikes.</p></section>
